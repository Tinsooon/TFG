# Advanced Analytics AI Applications: Predicting Churn in Digital Experience Business

Welcome to the repository for the final project "Advanced Analytics AI Applications: Predicting Churn in Digital Experience Business". This repository contains all the materials related to the project, including the project document, a Python notebook, and an interactive dashboard.

## Abstract

This study explores the development and implementation of a churn prediction solution for Dynatrace, a software monitoring platform. By using historical customer data as well as relevant features, this project aims to build an effective predictive model capable of identifying customers at risk of churn. This solution also includes a component of Explainability AI, where we analyze and interpret the model’s predictions to provide insights into the factors contributing to customer churn. For a better understanding of the data, an interactive dashboard was also built, allowing team members to explore the model’s predictions and gain actionable insights.
